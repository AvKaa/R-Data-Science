Random variable times a constant
  The expected value of a random variable multiplied by a constant is that constant times its original expected value:
      E[aX] = a?? 
  The standard error of a random variable multiplied by a constant is that constant times its original standard error:
      SE[aX] = a?? 

Average of multiple draws of a random variable
  The expected value of the average of multiple draws from an urn is the expected value of the urn (??).
  The standard deviation of the average of multiple draws from an urn is the standard deviation of the urn divided by the square root of the number of draws (??/???(n)).

The sum of multiple draws of a random variable
  The expected value of the sum of n draws of a random variable is n times its original expected value:
      E[nX] = n?? 
  The standard error of the sum of n draws of random variable is ???(n) times its original standard error:
      SE[nX] = ???(n??) 

The sum of multiple different random variables
  The expected value of the sum of different random variables is the sum of the individual expected values for each random variable:
      E[X1+X2+???+Xn] = ??1+??2+???+??n 
  The standard error of the sum of different random variables is the square root of the sum of squares of the individual standard errors:
      SE[X1+X2+???+Xn] = ???(??21+??22+???+??2n)
      
Transformation of random variables
  If X is a normally distributed random variable and a and b are non-random constants, then  aX+b  is also a normally distributed random variable.
